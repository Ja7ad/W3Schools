<h1>              Tobias</h1>

<p>In HTML the display does not show more than one space,
but if you view the page source you will see that there are
20 characters between &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;.</p>

<p>Or, to demonstrate we can use a PRE element to see that "Tobias" is right aligned:</p>

<pre>King               Tobias Refsnes</pre>

<p>In views.py you can see what the name variable looks like.</p>
